# Quarterly Reports

Quarterly reports are a pivotal part to any organization to understand where you're achieving your goals and where you need to improve. 
 
My goal with this project was to clean/organize data collected by the library, create a variety of informative data visualizations around the core functions of the library, and present that data in a cohesive quarterly report that could be utilized by management to guide policy.
