# Quarterly Reports

Quarterly reports are a pivotal part to any organization. They help identify where an organization is achieving their goals and areas that need improvement.  
 
My goal with this project was to clean/organize data collected by the library, create a variety of informative data visualizations around the core functions of the library, and present that data in a cohesive quarterly report that could be utilized by management to guide/influence/justify policy.
